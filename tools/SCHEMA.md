# Estate dashboard data schema (one JSON file per estate)

Write UTF-8 JSON. Use numbers (not strings) for figures. Use null when a figure is not in the reports. NEVER invent or estimate a number; every figure must come from the report text. Money in RM. Fertiliser doses in GRAMS per palm (2.25 kg -> 2250).

 "folder": "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/<estate folder id>",
 "blockPeriod": "Jan–May 2026",     // the months the block-level ytd/prevYtd figures cover (may differ from kpi.ffbPeriod!)
 "blockSrc": "Agronomy Report 1/2026 Table 17",   // which report/table the block yields come from
 "ytdCurrent": {"year": 2026, "period": "Jan–Jun 2026", "yph": 0, "prevSame": 0, "src": "Agronomy Report 1/2026 Table 13"}
     // ONLY when the latest full-year in kpi is e.g. Jan–Dec 2025 but a report also gives current-year-to-date estate yield. Otherwise omit.
Every yield figure must have its period. Every period must be exactly what the report says.

## ffbProd (FFB production tonnes — drives the estate "FFB production" chart and the group chart)
```
"ffbProd": {
  "years": [{"year": 2025, "t": 28187.68, "src": "PA Report 1/2026 Section 8"}],   // full calendar years only, whole estate, as printed
  "monthly": {"2025": [Jan..Dec or null], "2026": [Jan..Dec or null]},             // printed monthly tonnes
  "monthlySrc": "...",
  "ytd": {"year": 2026, "from": 1, "to": 5, "t": 7375.22, "src": "..."},           // latest printed cumulative tonnage this year
  "combinedWith": "juasa-b",   // only when the ytd figure covers two estates (Juasa A+B); put it on one estate only
  "notes": "conflicts, partial years (not shown to clients)"
}
```
Never compute tonnes from t/ha × area. The group page sums 2026 to the month that the most estates can be matched to (monthly series up to that month, or a cumulative total ending exactly that month).

## blocks[].detail and blockEstateWide (full per-block report content)
```
"detail": {
  "manuring":  [row], "spraying": [row], "pests": [row], "yield": [row], "harvesting": [row],
  "pruning": [row], "nutrients": [row], "field": [row], "other": [row],
  "fertNow":  {"year": 2026, "rows": [row]},   // current programme, g/palm, by month
  "fertPrev": {"year": 2025, "rows": [row]},   // previous year's programme (from the previous Agronomy report)
  "fertNext": {"year": 2027, "rows": [row]}    // only if a report already gives next year's programme
}
row = {"k": "short label", "v": "finding with figures and the period", "src": "PA 2/2026" | "Agro 1/2026"}
"blockEstateWide": {"manuring": [row], "spraying": [row], "pests": [row], ...}   // estate-level facts, not repeated per block
"blockGaps", "blockMap": internal notes (not shown)
```
Be exhaustive: everything the latest PA and Agronomy reports say about the block. Programmes for year N
sit in the Agronomy report of the visit before (e.g. 2025 programme in Agro 1/2025; Agro 2/YYYY holds next year's).

`detail.progress` = {"manuring": [bar], "manuringPeriod": "to Jun 2026", "spraying": [bar], "sprayingPeriod": "Jan–Jun 2026"}
bar = {"k": "Mix B · round 1 (Feb)", "pct": 100, "note": "103.3 t · 380 ha", "src": "PA 2/2026", "calc": false}
Latest year only; pct as printed, or done ÷ programme with calc true; rows fully shown by bars are removed from detail.manuring/spraying.

`blocks[].yhist` = {"years": {"2026": 24.23, ...}, "src": "Agro 1/2026 Appendix 2"} — block t/ha by FULL year as printed (UMB: keys are FY end years, 2026 = FY2025/26); only when ≥2 years. Shown first on the Blocks tab.

## UMB financial years (May–Apr) — this site only
UMB estates report by financial year May–Apr. site.json / assets/site.js set fyStart = 5 and cur = 2026 (the reporting year the group summary sums, FY2025/26,
named by the year it ends in; move to 2027 once most estates' reports run into FY2026/27). Charts then label years "FY2025/26" and months run May → Apr.
 "yieldHistory": [{"year": 2026, "label": "FY2025/26", "period": "May 2025–Apr 2026", "yph": 0}]   // year = the FY's END year
 "ytdCurrent":  {"year": 2027, "label": "FY2026/27", "period": "May–Jun 2026", "yph": 0, "prevSame": 0, "src": "Agronomy Report 2/2026 Table 18"}
     // the current FY to date. Omit if the latest full FY is already the newest figure.
 "ffbProd": {
   "years":   [{"year": 2026, "label": "FY2025/26", "t": 0, "src": "..."}],   // FULL financial years only (12 months, May–Apr), as printed
   "monthly": {"2026": [May..Apr], "2027": [May..Apr]},                       // keyed by FY end year; index 0 = May … 11 = Apr; null where not printed
   "ytd":     {"year": 2027, "from": 1, "to": 2, "t": 0, "src": "..."},      // from/to are FY month numbers: 1 = May, 2 = Jun … 12 = Apr
   "combinedWith": null, "notes": "..."
 }
 An 11-month FY total (e.g. May 2025–Mar 2026) is NOT a full year: put it in ytd with year = that FY's end year only if no newer FY figure exists,
 otherwise only in notes. Calendar-year data (e.g. rainfall Jan–Dec) keeps plain "year".
Keep kpi.ffbPeriod / copPeriod / blockPeriod short, e.g. "May 2025–Mar 2026 (FY2025/26, 11 months)".
