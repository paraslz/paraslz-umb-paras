# Estate dashboard data schema (one JSON file per estate)

Write UTF-8 JSON. Use numbers (not strings) for figures. Use null when a figure is not in the reports. NEVER invent or estimate a number; every figure must come from the report text. Money in RM. Fertiliser doses in GRAMS per palm (2.25 kg -> 2250).
